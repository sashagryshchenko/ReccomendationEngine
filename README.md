# ReccomendationEngine
Big project involving three messy Anime data sets used to make recommendations for users - done using Python. The data were retrevied from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist) and the files are not available on this Github page given their large size, so please refer to the link for potential analyses.
